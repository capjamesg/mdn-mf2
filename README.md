# mdn-mf2

Community resource to collaborate on microformats2 wiki page(s) for MDN.

## Resources

- [The current, live MDN Microformats page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/microformats)
- [MDN Content repository](https://github.com/mdn/content)

## Collaborating

This repository is for proposing and making changes to a version of the MDN page that will be submitted for consideration to the mdn/content repository.

Before submitting any changes, we want to get feedback from the microformats community on how to improve the page.

All changes to this page should be made with the question "how will this help a web developer?" in mind. We should avoid adding information about microformats without clear consuming use cases.

## Contact

To discuss this project, join the #microformats channel via IRC on [libera.chat](https://libera.chat). You can also join this channel via Slack, Discord, or Matrix. Learn more about how to do this on the [IndieWeb Discuss page](https://indieweb.org/discuss).
